you are taxed with building a backend API for a library management system,which
will manage books, authors,borrowers, and borrowing processes. This system
includes special constraints, and the interactions between entities must reflect
real-world library management challenges Schema Requirements: Book:
title(String,required) author(Reference to Author,required) isbn(String,unique,
required) available_copies(Number,required,non-Negative) Additional
constraints:if a book has been borrowed more than 10 times ,the available copies
cannot exceed 100 Author: name (String,required)
email(String,unique,required,must be a valid email)
phone(String,unique,required,must be a valid phone number) Additional
constraints:an author can have at most 5 books Borrower: name(String,required)
borrowed_books(Array of References to Book) membersgipActive(Boolean,required)
membershiptype(Enum:Standard,Platinum,required) Additional constraints: Premium
borrower can borrow at most 10 books at a time while standard borrowers can
borrow at most 5 books at a time API Routes: implement crud operations for each
entity Book: implement operations to crud books .Ensure that the available
copies are updated when a book is borrowed or returned Author: implement
operations to crud authors.Ensure that an author cannot have more than 5 books
at once Borrorwer: implement operations to crud borrowers.Ensure that the
borrowing constraints are enforced Handling error: Handle edge cases such as
Borrowing a book that is not available Borrowing a book when the borrower has
reached the borrowing limit Business Rules: Borrower and Return mechanism:
Decrease the available copies of a book when it is borrowed Increase the
available copies of a book when it is returned Apply different borrowing
constraints based on the membership type of the borrower Additional Constraints:
implement a rule that prevents an author from being linked to more than 5 books
at once ,provide an api route that returns a list of authors who have reached
this limit implement a business rule that prevents bororwers from borrowing who
have overdue books,even if they have active membership
